# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the **delivery time of food** using machine learning models. The project takes into account factors such as distance, preparation time, courier experience, weather conditions, and traffic levels to predict the time it will take for food to be delivered.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes the dataset to gain insights into relationships between features.
- **Modeling:** Implements various regression models to predict delivery time, including:
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - XGBoost
    - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet
